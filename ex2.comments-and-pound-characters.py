# Learn Python the Hard Way
# Exercise 2 - Comments and Pound Characters

# A comment, this is so you can read your programme later
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this" # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't be executed."

print "This, however, will be executed."
